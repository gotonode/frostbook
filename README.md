# Frostbook
*A social media app* (development paused)

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/gotonode/frostbook.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/gotonode/frostbook)

Frostbook is hosted on Heroku at the following link: [https://frostbook.herokuapp.com/](https://frostbook.herokuapp.com/)

> Notice! Since this app uses Heroku's free dyno (a virtual environment), **the first (HTTP/S) request to the server will take up to 10 seconds**. This will wake the server up. Subsequent requests are served immediately. After about 30 minutes of inactivity, the dyno sleeps (idle-state) until the next request wakes it up again.
